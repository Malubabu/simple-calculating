# simple-calculating
This project contains a simple Python script that implements basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
●Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before starting the creation of a simple calculator in Python, ensured that Python installed on the system, which can be downloaded from the official website. Additionally, must have a basic understanding of Python programming concepts, such as variables, data types, functions, and control structures. A text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) will be necessary for writing and editing code.Also need access to a terminal or command prompt for executing Python scripts and commands. Optionally, if ,plan to use version control and host the project on GitHub, ensure Git is installed on the system. With these prerequisites in place, ready to embark on creating Python calculator project.
Installing
Setting up To install the necessary libraries, execute: pip install pymysql, pandas, and sqlalchemy
Running the Tests
Breakdown of Tests
In order to connect to the MySQL server, set up the environment. Install the package Pymysql. In order to connect to the MySQL server, create an engine. • Execute a Basic Query In a data frame, read a straightforward SQL query from the database. Print the data frame's initial few rows. • Execute a Complex Inquiry Read a sophisticated SQL query into a data frame from the database that includes aggregation and filtering. Print the DataFrame containing the total sales information for action games published after 2005.
Deployment
Any environment with Python and MySQL installed can host this lab. Make that the MySQL server connection details are configured correctly and that the required libraries are installed.
